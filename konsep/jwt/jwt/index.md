## Definisi
- **Asana**: 
  - Open standard
  - Used to share security information
  - Between two parties â€” a client and a server
  - Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims
  - JWTs are [signed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/454069) using a [cryptographic algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cryptographic-algorithm) to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
- [**JWT.io**](https://jwt.io/introduction):
  - Open standard (RFC 7519)
  - Defines a compact and self-contained way
  - For securely transmitting information between parties
  - As a JSON object
  - This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed
  - Can be signed using a [secret](https://www.hypr.com/secret-key/) (with the HMAC algorithm)
  - Or a [public/private key pair](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/private-key-pair) using RSA or ECDSA.
